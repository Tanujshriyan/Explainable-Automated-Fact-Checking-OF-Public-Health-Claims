    "### Introduction\n",
    "#### This Jupyter notebook focuses on fact-checking of public health claims using three different models:\n",
    "1. Naive Bayes\n",
    "2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\n",
    "3. Llama2 \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation\n",
    "for each of these approaches. By comparing these models, we aim to explore their effectiveness\n",
    "in distinguishing between true and false health-related claims, which is crucial for combating\n",
    "misinformation in the public health domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline\n",
    "The disseration has to be submitted by 2pm Monday 19th August 2024\n",

    "## Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "The code cells in this notebook demonstrate various functionalities such as data manipulation, data visualization, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, classification, and model training. The cells are organized in a sequential manner, and each cell serves a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells are used to provide documentation and describe the workflow of the notebook. They allow for easy formatting and provide a way to explain the code and its purpose. Markdown cells can contain headings, lists, images, links, and other formatting options to enhance readability and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow of this notebook is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing necessary libraries and modules.\n",
    "2. Loading and preprocessing the data.\n",
    "3. Exploratory data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "4. Text preprocessing and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "5. Classification using Naive Bayes classifier.\n",
    "6. Training and evaluating a BERT model.\n",
    "7. Prompt Engineering of Llama2 Model\n",
    "8. Markdown cells for documentation and explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this workflow, the notebook provides a comprehensive example of how to work with data, perform analysis, and build models using Jupyter Notebook.\n",

no trash or other items were left behind we did request that those not associated with the sponsors leave the room prior to our session the girl scouts of the usa was not contacted by catholic family

benefits of spending your retirement money living on a cruise ship instead of a retirement home  an email comparison living on a cruise ship with living in a retirement facility has circulated on the internet for quite a while it was mostly speculative and humorous then versions started circulating saying that the writer had actually met someone on a cruise who was living aboard the ship and paying for repeated cruises instead of living on land weve not found the source of the original email or anybody who has actually had the experience stumbling across a retired person who has elected to live as a cruse ship passenger because it was cheaper than living on land the idea however is not complete fiction two experts on elder care from the northwestern university school of medicine have evaluated the idea and their thoughts were published in the november issue of the journal of the american geriatrics society then theres the story of yearold bea muller of florida her husband died aboard the queen elizabeth while on a world cruise in face with moving back home to live alone in a retirement center she decided to sell everything and book herself onto the ship one year at a time shes been doing that ever since even after the queen elizabeth stopped doing transatlantic crossings and operating only in europe she is said to still dance each night away with her constantly rotating clusters of new friends last updated about years ago we were on a cruise through the western mediterranean aboard a princess liner at dinner we noticed an elderly lady sitting alone along the rail of the grand stairway in the main dining room i also noticed that all the staff ships officers waiters busboys etc all seemed very familiar with this lady i asked our waiter whom the lady was expecting to be told she owned the line but he said he only knew that she had been on board for the last four cruises back to back as we left the dining room one evening i caught her eye and stopped to say hello we chatted and i said i understand youve been on this ship for the last four cruises she replied yes thats true i stated i dont understand she replied without a pause its cheaper than a nursing home heres the proof when i get old and feeble i am going to get on a princess cruise ship the average cost for a nursing home is per day i have checked on reservations at princess and i can get a long term discount and senior discount price of per day that leaves a day for gratuities which will only be per day i will have as many as meals a day if i can waddle to the restaurant or i can have room service which means i can have breakfast in bed every day of the week princess has as many as three swimming pools a workout room free washers and dryers and shows every night they have free toothpaste and razors and free soap and shampoo they will even treat you like a customer not a patient an extra worth of tips will have the entire staff scrambling to help you i will get to meet new people every or days tv broken light bulb need changing need to have the mattress replaced no problem they will fix everything and apologize for your inconvenience clean sheets and towels every day and you dont even have to ask for them if you fall in the nursing home and break a hip you are on medicare if you fall and break a hip on the princess ship they will upgrade you to a suite for the rest of your life now hold on for the best do you want to see south america the panama canal tahiti australia new zealand asia or name where you want to go princess will have a ship ready to go so

use of the fword on any tv or radio show at any time of day or night its in the form of an appeal from the american family association urging citizens to complain to the fcc and to members of congress  an federal communications commission fcc decision about a particular occurrence of the fword on a telecast has sparked controversy but it isnt accurate to say that the fcc has approved blanket use of the fword on radio and television on april the fcc released a public notice requesting comments regarding their indecency policies click for statement currently the fcc has a guideline posted on their website stressing that content is important to whether or not they will pursue a broadcaster for violations the guideline said it is a violation of federal law to air obscene programming at any time it is also a violation of federal law to air indecent programming or profane language during certain hours congress has given the federal communications commission fcc the responsibility for administratively enforcing these laws the fcc may revoke a station license impose a monetary forfeiture or issue a warning if a station airs obscene indecent or profane material it was during the golden globes awards telecast on january that bono of the band u told the audience this is really really f___ing brilliant the fcc said the comment was also reported as this is f___ing great there were numerous complaints the fcc issued a ruling that said bono used the word as an adjective and not to describe sexual or excretory organs or activities which is the fccs key test for broadcast indecency in its ruling the fcc said that such fleeting and isolated remarks of this nature do not warrant commission action still critics are saying that even the use of the fword as an adjective has not been that common on broadcasts primarily because of fear of running afoul of the fcc and they fear this will mark a change the fcc responds to complaints of viewers and listeners and rulings regarding objectionable words and scenes have been made before especially about radio programs an fcc decision is not the only one affecting what is broadcast there are also local or state laws that

    "## Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will implement a Naive Bayes classifier to classify text data. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that is commonly used for text classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Implement Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the text data by tokenizing it, converting it to lowercase, and removing stop words and non-alphabetic characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the preprocessed text data. This can be done using techniques such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the Naive Bayes classifier, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: Train the Naive Bayes classifier using the training set. This involves estimating the probabilities of each class and the conditional probabilities of each feature given each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained Naive Bayes classifier using the testing set. This can be done by calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Prediction**: Use the trained Naive Bayes classifier to make predictions on new, unseen text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to implement a Naive Bayes classifier using scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 1: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "# Preprocess the text data by tokenizing it, converting it to lowercase, and removing stop words and non-alphabetic characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Feature Extraction\n",
    "# Extract features from the preprocessed text data using techniques such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 3: Train-Test Split\n",
    "# Split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 4: Model Training\n",
    "# Train the Naive Bayes classifier using the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 5: Model Evaluation\n",
    "# Evaluate the performance of the trained Naive Bayes classifier using the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 6: Prediction\n",
    "# Use the trained Naive Bayes classifier to make predictions on new, unseen text data.\n",
    "```\n",
    "By following these steps, you can implement a Naive Bayes classifier to classify text data effectively.\n",
